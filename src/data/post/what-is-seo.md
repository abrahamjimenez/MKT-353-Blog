## What is blog SEO?

Blog Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing a blog's content, images, HTML code, architecture,
and web loading speed.

## Why is blog SEO important?

Search engines, like Google, are an excellent source of blog traffic.

An optimized blog helps achieve these few critical things, the most influential being ranking in the top spots five on Google's front page. Did you know that these spots generate 70% of all clicks? Adding optimized blog SEO strategies will help you rank in those high-value spots for relevant searches. Such behavior will drive your desired visitors to find your blog in the search results within your industry.

When your blog posts rank high for a highly searched query, it has the potential to increase your website traffic to thousands of visitors. Otherwise, if you relied on paid methods to receive comparable results from Google search, be prepared to spend hundreds or thousands to gain traffic.

Another less-discussed benefit is how good SEO leads to a more reputable and trustworthy brand image. Ranking on the first page of Google attests to searchers that your business creates high-quality content.
