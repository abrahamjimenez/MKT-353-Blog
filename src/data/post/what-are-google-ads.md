## What Are Google Ads?

Google Ads is an online advertising platform where businesses can create and run paid ads to appear on Google search
results, YouTube, and other websites. Google Ads run on a **pay-per-click (PPC)** system, meaning you will only get charged when
someone clicks on your ad.

## How Google Ads Work?

1. **Choose keywords** - Select terms related to your business.
2. **Create Ads** - Design text, image, or video ads targeting potential customers.
3. **Set a Budget and Bidding Strategy** - Decide on how much you are willing to pay per click.
4. **Ad Auction & Ranking** - Google decides which ads show based on the bid amount, ad relevance, and quality score.
5. **Measure Performance** - [You track clicks](what-are-google-analytics.md), impressions, conversions, and return on investment (ROI)
